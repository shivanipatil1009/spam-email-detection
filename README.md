# Spam Email Detection using Machine Learning

This project is a basic Machine Learning model that classifies emails as spam or not spam using text-based features.

##  Project Overview
The goal of this project is to understand the workflow of a machine learning classification system.  
It includes data preparation, text vectorization, model training, and prediction.

##  Features
- Text preprocessing using CountVectorizer
- Training a Naive Bayes classifier
- Spam vs Non-spam prediction
- Accuracy evaluation
- Custom message testing

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- NumPy

##  How It Works
1. Sample email data is converted into numerical format using CountVectorizer.
2. The dataset is split into training and testing sets.
3. A Naive Bayes model is trained on the dataset.
4. The model predicts whether a new message is spam or not.

##  Project Purpose
This project demonstrates basic knowledge of:
- Machine Learning workflow
- Text classification
- Python data handling
- Model training and evaluation

##  Future Improvements
- Use real email dataset
- Improve model accuracy
- Add GUI or web interface
- Deploy the model
